\subsection{}

For every topological space~$X$, every set-theoretic map from~$X$ to~$I(S)$ is continuous.
This can also be formulated as follows:
Let~$i$ be the set-theoretic map from~$S$ to~$I(S)$ given by~$i(s) ≔ s$ for every~$s ∈ S$.
There exists for any set-theoretic map~$f$ from~$X$ to~$S$ a unique continuous map~$\induced{f}$ from~$X$ to~$I(S)$ with~$\induced{f} = i ∘ f$, i.e., such that the following diagram commutes.

		\\
		S
		\arrow{r}[above]{i}
		&
		I(S)
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
