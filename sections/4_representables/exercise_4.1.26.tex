\begin{itemize}

	\item
		We can assign to each topological space~$X$ its set of path-components~$\fgroup_0(X)$, resulting in a functor
		\[
			\fgroup_0 \colon \hTop \to \Set \,.
		\]
		This functor is represented by the one-point topological space.

	\item
		We have a functor~$(\ph)^×$ that assigns to each ring its group of units, i.e., its multiplicative group of invertible elements.
	When this functor is composed with the forgetful functor from~$\Grp$ to~$\Set$, it becomes representable by the ring of integral Laurent series~$ℤ[t, t^{-1}]$.

	\item
		Let~$G$ be a group.
		To every~\set{$G$}~$X$ we can assign its set~$X^G$ of fixed points, i.e., the set
		\[
			X^G = \{ x ∈ X \suchthat \text{$g ⋅ x = x$ for every element~$g$ of~$G$} \} \,.
		\]
		Every homomorphism of~\sets{$G$} restricts to a map between fixed points, whence the construction~$(\ph)^G$ results in a functor from~$\GSet{G}$ to~$\Set$.
		This functor is represented by the one-point~\set{$G$}.
