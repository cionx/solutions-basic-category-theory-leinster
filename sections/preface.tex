The following document contains my personal solutions to the exercises in Tom Leinsterâ€™s \emph{Basic Category Theory} \cite{leinster_basic_category}.
There is no guarantee that these solutions are correct or complete.

Similar collections of solutions can be found at \cite{positron_basic_category_theory_solutions} and \cite{weiss_basic_category_theory_solutions}.
