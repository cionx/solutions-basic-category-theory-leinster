\subsubsection*{Left adjoint}

For any two sets~$A$ and~$B$, let~$i_A$ and~$j_B$ denote the inclusion maps from~$A$ and~$B$ to~$A + B$ respectively.

There exists for every pair~$(f, g)$ of maps
\[
	f \colon A \to A' \,,
	\quad
	g \colon B \to B'
\]
a unique induced map
\[
	f + g \colon A + B \to A' + B' \,,
\]
such that
\[
	(f + g) ∘ i_A = f
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	(f + g) ∘ j_B = g \,.%
	\footnote{
		If one thinks about the sum~$A + B$ as the disjoint union of the sets~$A$ and~$B$, then the function~$f + g$ is given for every element~$x$ of~$A + B$ by
		\[
			(f + g)(x)
			=
			\begin{cases*}
				f(x) & if~$x ∈ A$, \\
				g(x) & if~$x ∈ B$.
			\end{cases*}
		\]
	}
\]
We have for every two sets~$A$ and~$B$ the equality
\[
	\id_A + \id_B = \id_{A + B} \,,
\]
and for all maps of the form
\[
	f \colon A \to A' \,,
	\quad
	f' \colon A' \to A'' \,,
	\quad
	g \colon B \to B' \,,
	\quad
	g' \colon B' \to B'' \,,
\]
the equality
\[
	(f' + g') ∘ (f + g)
	=
	(f' ∘ f) + (g' ∘ g) \,.
\]
This means that we have a functor
\[
	S \colon \Set × \Set \to \Set
\]
that is given by
\[
	S(A, B) ≔ A + B
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	S(f, g) = f + g
\]
for every object~$(A, B)$ of~$\Set × \Set$ and every morphism~$(f, g)$ of~$\Set × \Set$.

We have for every three sets~$A$,~$B$ and~$C$ a bijection
\[
	\Set(A + B, C)
	\to
	\Set(A, C) × \Set(B, C) \,,
\]
given by
\[
	h \mapsto (h ∘ i_A, h ∘ j_B) \,.
\]
The codomain of this bijection can be rewritten as
\begin{align*}
	\Set(A, C) × \Set(B, C)
	&=
	(\Set × \Set)( (A, B), (C, C) )
	\\
	&=
	(\Set × \Set)( (A, B), Δ(C) ) \,,
\end{align*}
and its domain as
\[
	\Set( S(A, B), C ) \,.
\]
We have thus constructed a bijection
\[
	\Set( S(A, B), C ) \to (\Set × \Set)( (A, B), Δ(C) ) \,.
\]
It can be checked that this bijection is natural in both~$(A, B)$ and~$C$.
The functor~$S$ is therefore left adjoint to the diagonal functor~$Δ$.



\subsubsection*{Right adjoint}

Every pair~$(f, g)$ of maps
\[
	f \colon A \to A' \,,
	\quad
	g \colon B \to B'
\]
induces a map
\[
	f × g \colon A × B \to A' × B'
\]
given by
\[
	(f × g)(a, b) ≔ ( f(a), g(b) )
\]
for every element~$(a, b)$ of~$A × B$.
We have for every two sets~$A$ and~$B$ the equality
\[
	\id_A × \id_B = \id_{A × B} \,,
\]
and for any maps of the form
\[
	f \colon A \to A' \,,
	\quad
	f' \colon A' \to A'' \,,
	\quad
	g \colon B \to B' \,,
	\quad
	g' \colon B' \to B'' \,,
\]
the equality
\[
	(f' × g') ∘ (f × g)
	=
	(f' ∘ f) × (g' ∘ g) \,.
\]
This means that we have a functor
\[
	P \colon \Set × \Set \to \Set
\]
that is given by
\[
	P(A, B) ≔ A × B \,,
	\quad
	P(f, g) = f × g
\]
for every object~$(A, B)$ of~$\Set × \Set$ and every morphism~$(f, g)$ of~$\Set × \Set$.

We have for every three sets~$A$,~$B$ and~$C$ a bijection
\[
	\Set(A, B) × \Set(A, C) \,,
	\to
	\Set(A, B × C)
\]
given by
\[
	(f, g) \mapsto [ a \mapsto (f(a), g(a)) ]
\]
for every element~$(f, g)$ of~$\Set(A, B) × \Set(A, C)$.
The domain of this bijection can be rewritten as
\begin{align*}
	\Set(A, B) × \Set(A, C)
	&=
	(\Set × \Set)( (A, A), (B, C) )
	\\
	&=
	(\Set × \Set)( Δ(A), (B, C) ) \,,
\end{align*}
and its codomain as
\[
	\Set( A, P(B, C) ) \,.
\]
We have thus constructed a bijection
\[
	(\Set × \Set)( Δ(A), (B, C) )
	\to
	\Set( A, P(B, C) ) \,.
\]
It can be checked that this bijection is natural in both~$A$ and~$(B, C)$.
The functor~$P$ is therefore right adjoint to the diagonal functor~$Δ$.
