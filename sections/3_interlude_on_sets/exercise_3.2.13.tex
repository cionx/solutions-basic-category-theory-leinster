\subsubsection{}

We denote the given subset of~$A$ by~$B$.
Suppose that there exists an element~$a$ of~$A$ with~$B = f(a)$.
We then have the equivalences
\[
	a ∈ B
	\iff
	a ∉ f(a)
	\iff
	a ∉ B \,,
\]
and thus a contradiction.
Therefore,~$f$ cannot be surjective.



\subsubsection{}

We know that~$\card{A} ≤ \card{\Power(A)}$ because there exists an injective function from~$A$ to~$\Power(A)$, namely~$a \mapsto \{ a \}$.
We have seen in part~(a) of this exercise that there exists no surjective function from~$A$ to~$\Power(A)$.
This entails that there exists no bijection between~$A$ and~$\Power(A)$, so that~$\card{A} ≠ \card{\Power(A)}$.
This shows altogether that~$\card{A} < \card{\Power(A)}$.
