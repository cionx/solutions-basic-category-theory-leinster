\subsection{}

We need to show that for every two parallel morphisms
\[
	r, s \colon Y \to X'
\]
in~$\cat{A}$ with~$m' ∘ r = m' ∘ s$, we have~$r = s$.
We find that
\[
	m ∘ f' ∘ r
	=
	f ∘ m' ∘ r
	=
	f ∘ m' ∘ s
	=
	m ∘ f' ∘ s
\]
by the commutativity of the given diagram.
It follows that
\[
	f' ∘ r = f' ∘ s
\]
because the morphism~$m$ is monic.
We know from the universal property of the pullback that any morphism~$t$ from~$Y$ to~$X'$ is uniquely determined by its pair of composites~$m' ∘ t$ and~$f' ∘ t$.
We have seen that both~$m' ∘ r = m' ∘ s$ and~$f' ∘ r = f' ∘ s$, so we conclude that~$r = s$.
