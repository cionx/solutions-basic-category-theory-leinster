\subsection{}

Let
\[
	r, s \colon Y \to X'
\]
be two parallel morphisms in~$\cat{A}$ with~$m' ∘ r = m' ∘ s$.
It follows that
\[
	m ∘ f' ∘ r
	=
	f ∘ m' ∘ r
	=
	f ∘ m' ∘ s
	=
	m ∘ f' ∘ s
\]
by the commutativity of the pullback diagram, and therefore
\[
	f' ∘ r = f' ∘ s
\]
because the morphism~$m$ is monic.
We know from the universal property of the pullback that any morphism~$t$ from~$Y$ to~$X'$ is uniquely determined by its pair of composites~$m' ∘ t$ and~$f' ∘ t$.
We have now seen that for~$t = r$ and~$t = s$ we get the same pairs of composites, so it follows that~$r = s$.
