The coequalizer of~$f$ and~$\id_X$ is given by the quotient set~$X / {∼}$, where~$∼$ is the equivalence relation on~$X$ generated by
\[
	x ∼ f(x)
	\qquad
	\text{for every~$x ∈ X$} \,.
\]
This equivalence relation can also be described more explicitly as follows:
two elements~$x$ and~$y$ of~$X$ are equivalent with respect to~$∼$ if and only if they are contained in the same~$f$\nobreakdash-orbit, i.e., if and only if there exist natural exponents~$n$ and~$m$ with
\[
	f^n(x) = f^m(y) \,.
\]

Alternatively, let~$Γ$ be the following directed graph:
the vertices of~$Γ$ are the elements of~$X$, and there exists an edge from~$x$ to~$y$ in~$Γ$ if and only if~$y = f(x)$.
Two elements of~$X$ are equivalent with respect to~$∼$ if and only if they lie in the same undirected connected component of~$Γ$.
The set~$X / {∼}$ can be identified with the set of undirected connected components of~$Γ$.

We want to give special attention to the case that~$f$ is bijective:
in this case, the elements of~$X$ that are equivalent to a specific element~$x$ are precisely those of the form~$f^n(x)$ with~$n ∈ ℤ$.



\subsubsection{}

Let~$X$ be a topological space and let
\[
	f \colon X \to X
\]
be a continuous map.
To construct the coequalizer of~$f$ we take the construction from part~(a) of this exercise and endow the quotient~$X / {∼}$ with the quotient topology induced from~$X$.

For~$X = \Sphere^1$ we may consider the rotation map
\[
	f
	\colon
	\Sphere^1 \to \Sphere^1 \,,
	\quad
	x \mapsto \eul^{2 \pi \img α} x
\]
for some irrational number~$α$.
For every element of~$X$, its orbit under~$f$ is a countable, dense subset of~$\Sphere^1$.
The quotient space~$X / {∼}$ is therefore an uncountable, indiscrete topological space.
