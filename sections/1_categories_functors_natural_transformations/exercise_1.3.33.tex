\subsection{}

We consider an auxiliary category~$\Acat$ as follows:
The objects of~$\Acat$ are pairs~$(V, B)$ consisting of a finite-dimensional~\vectorspace{$\kf$}~$V$ and a basis~$B$ of~$V$.
For any two objects~$(V, B)$ and~$(W, C)$ of~$\Acat$ the respective set of morphism~$\Acat( (V, B), (W, C) )$ is the set of linear maps from~$V$ to~$W$.
The composition in~$\Acat$ is the usual composition of linear maps.

We have a forgetful functor~$F$ from~$\Acat$ to~$\FDVect$ that is given on objects by
\[
	F((V, B)) = V
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	F(f) = f
\]
on objects and morphisms respectively.
This functor is fully faithful and surjective, and hence an equivalence.

We also have a functor~$G$ from~$\Acat$ to~$\Matcat$ as follows:
It is given on objects by
\[
	G( (V, B) ) = \dim(V) \,.
\]
It assigns to each morphism
\[
	f \colon (V, B) \to (W, C)
\]
in~$\Acat$ the matrix that represents the linear map~$f$ with respect to the bases~$B$ and~$C$.
This functor is fully faithful and surjective, and therefore an equivalence.

The category~$\Acat$ is both equivalent to~$\FDVect$ and to~$\Matcat$.
It follows (from the upcoming Exercise~1.3.34) that~$\FDVect$ and~$\Matcat$ are also equivalent.

A quasi-inverse~$G'$ for~$G$ is given on objects by~$G'(n) = (\kf^n, (e_1, \dotsc, e_n))$ for every natural number~$n$ and on morphisms by~$G'(A)(x) = Ax$ for every matrix~$A$ and column vector~$x$ (of suitable size).

A quasi-inverse~$F'$ for~$F$ together with a natural isomorphism from~$F' F$ to~$1_{\FDVect}$ amounts to choosing a basis for every finite-dimensional~\vectorspace{$\kf$}.
