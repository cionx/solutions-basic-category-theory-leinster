\subsection{}

The category~$\Ab$ of abelian groups:
the class of objects of~$\Ab$ is the class of abelian groups, the morphisms in~$\Ab$ are group homomorphisms, and composition of morphisms in~$\Ab$ is given by composition of functions.

For any ring~$R$ the category~$\Mod{R}$ left~\modules{$R$}:
the class of objects of~$\Mod{R}$ is the class of left~\modules{$R$}, the morphisms in~$\Mod{R}$ are homomorphisms of~\modules{$R$}, and composition of morphisms in~$\Mod{R}$ is given by composition of functions.

The category~$\Ord$ of partially ordered sets:
the class of objects of~$\Ord$ is the class of partially ordered sets, the morphisms in~$\Ord$ are order-preserving maps, and composition of morphisms in~$\Ord$ is given by composition of functions.
