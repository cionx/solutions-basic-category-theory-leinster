\subsection{}

For every topological space~$X$ let~$C(X)$ be the (commutative) ring of continuous, real-valued functions on~$X$.
For any two topological spaces~$X$ and~$Y$ and every continuous map~$f$ from~$X$ to~$Y$, let~$C(f)$ be the induced map
\[
	C(f)
	\colon
	C(Y) \to C(X) \,,
	\quad
	φ \mapsto φ ∘ f \,.
\]
This map is well-defined because the composite of two continuous maps is again continuous.

Let us check that map~$C(f)$ is a homomorphism of rings:
\begin{itemize}

	\item
		If we denote by~$⋆$ either addition or multiplication, then we have for every two elements~$φ$ and~$ψ$ of~$C(Y)$ the equalities
		\begin{align*}
			C(f)(φ ⋆ ψ)(x)
			&=
			((φ ⋆ ψ) ∘ f)(x)
			\\
			&=
			(φ ⋆ ψ)(f(x))
			\\
			&=
			φ(f(x)) ⋆ ψ(φ(x))
			\\
			&=
			(φ ∘ f)(x) ⋆ (ψ ∘ φ)(x)
			\\
			&=
			C(f)(φ)(x) ⋆ C(φ)(ψ)(x)
			\\
			&=
			(C(f)(φ) ⋆ C(φ)(ψ))(x)
		\end{align*}
		for every point~$x$ in~$X$, and thus the equality
		\[
			C(f)(φ ⋆ ψ) = C(f)(φ) ⋆ C(f)(ψ) \,.
		\]

	\item
		Let us denote by~$1_X$ and~$1_Y$ the functions with constant value~$1$ on~$X$ and~$Y$ respectively.
		We have
		\[
			C(f)(1_Y)
			=
			1_Y ∘ f
			=
			1_X \,,
		\]
		and thus~$C(f)(1) = 1$.

\end{itemize}
These calculations show that the map~$C(f)$ is indeed a homomorphism of rings from~$C(Y)$ to~$C(X)$.

Let us now check the functoriality of the construction~$C$.
\begin{itemize}

	\item
		For every topological space~$X$ we have
		\[
			C(\id_X)(φ)
			=
			φ ∘ \id_X
			=
			φ
			=
			\id_{C(X)}(φ)
		\]
		for every~$φ ∈ C(X)$, and therefore~$C(\id_X) = \id_{C(X)}$.
		(Here we denote by~$\id_X$ the identity map on the space~$X$.)

	\item
		For every two composable continuous maps
		\[
			f \colon X \to Y \,,
			\quad
			g \colon Y \to Z \,,
		\]
		we have the chain of equalities
		\begin{align*}
			C(g ∘ f)(φ)
			&=
			φ ∘ g ∘ f
			\\
			&=
			C(f)(φ ∘ g)
			\\
			&=
			C(f)( C(g)(φ) )
			\\
			&=
			( C(f) ∘ C(g) )(φ)
		\end{align*}
		for every~$φ ∈ C(Z)$, and therefore~$C(g ∘ f) = C(g) ∘ C(f)$.

\end{itemize}
This shows that~$C$ is indeed a contravariant functor from~$\Top$ to~$\Ring$.
