There exists by assumption a functor~$G$ from~$\cat{B}$ to~$\cat{A}$ such that the composite~$G ∘ F$ is isomorphic to the identity functor of~$\cat{A}$ and the composite~$F ∘ G$ is isomorphic to the identity functor of~$\cat{B}$.
This entails that
\[
	F(G(B)) ≅ B
\]
for every object~$B$ of~$\cat{B}$.
This shows that the functor~$F$ is essentially surjective.

Let~$A$ and~$A'$ be two objects of~$\cat{A}$.
Let~$α$ be a natural isomorphism from the composite~$G ∘ F$ to~$1_{\cat{A}}$.
The square diagram
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}[sep = large]
		GF(A)
		\arrow{r}[above]{GF(f)}
		\arrow{d}[left]{α_A}
		&
		GF(A')
		\arrow{d}[right]{α_{A'}}
		\\
		A
		\arrow{r}[above]{f}
		&
		A'
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
commutes for every morphism~$f \colon A \to A'$ in~$\cat{A}$.
We thus have
\[
	α_{A'} ∘ GF(f) ∘ α_A^{-1}
	=
	f
\]
for every morphism~$f \colon A \to A'$ in~$\cat{A}$.
In other words, the composite
\begin{equation}
	\label{composition_is_identity}
	\cat{A}(A, A')
	\xto{F}
	\cat{B}(F(A), F(A'))
	\xto{G}
	\cat{A}(GF(A), GF(A'))
	\xto{α_{A'} ∘ (\ph) ∘ α_A^{-1}}
	\cat{A}(A, A')
\end{equation}
is the identity map.
It follows that the map
\[
	\cat{A}(A, A')
	\xto{F}
	\cat{B}(F(A), F(A'))
\]
is injective, which shows that the functor~$F$ is faithful.

The functor~$G$ is essentially surjective since it is also an equivalence.
There hence exist for any two object~$A$ and~$A'$ of~$\cat{A}$ associated objects~$B$ and~$B'$ of~$\cat{B}$ and isomorphisms
\[
	β \colon F(A) \to B \,,
	\quad
	γ \colon F(A') \to B' \,.
\]
The composite~\eqref{composition_is_identity} that the identity map;
the last map is a bijection, whence the middle map
\[
	\cat{B}(F(A), F(A'))
	\xto{G}
	\cat{A}(GF(A), GF(A'))
\]
is surjective.
The square diagram
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = large, column sep = 7em]
		\cat{B}(F(A), F(A'))
		\arrow{r}[above]{γ ∘ (\ph) ∘ β^{-1}}
		\arrow{d}[left]{G}
		&
		\cat{B}(B, B')
		\arrow{d}[right]{G}
		\\
		\cat{B}(GF(A), GF(A'))
		\arrow{r}[above]{G(γ) ∘ (\ph) ∘ G(β)^{-1}}
		&
		\cat{B}(G(B), G(B'))
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
commutes and the two horizontal maps are bijections.
It follows that the map
\[
	\cat{B}(B, B')
	\xto{G}
	\cat{B}(G(B), G(B'))
\]
is surjective.
This shows that the functor~$G$ is full.

We have thus shown that every equivalence is faithful, full, and essentially surjective.



\subsubsection{}

Let~$F$ be a functor from~$\cat{A}$ to~$\cat{B}$ that is faithful, full, and essentially surjective.
There exists for every object~$B$ of~$\cat{B}$ an object~$G(B)$ of~$\cat{A}$ for which there exists an isomorphism
\[
	β_B \colon FG(B) \to B \,.
\]
For every morphism~$f \colon B \to B'$ in~$\cat{B}$, the conjugate~$β_{B'}^{-1} f β_B$ is then contained in~$\cat{B}(FG(B), FG(B'))$.
It follows that there exists a unique morphism~$G(f)$ from~$G(B)$ to~$G(B')$ such that
\[
	FG(f) = β_{B'}^{-1} f β_B
\]
because~$F$ is both full and faithful.

The assignment~$G$ is a functor from~$\cat{B}$ to~$\cat{A}$:
For every object~$B$ of~$\cat{B}$ we have
\[
	β_B^{-1} 1_B β_B
	=
	β_B^{-1} β_B
	=
	1_{FG(B)}
	=
	F(1_{G(B)})
\]
and therefore~$G(1_B) = 1_{G(B)}$.
For any two composable morphisms
\[
	f \colon B \to B'
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	g \colon B' \to B''
\]
in~$\cat{B}$ we have
\[
	β_{B''}^{-1} g f β_B
	=
	β_{B''}^{-1} g β_{B'} β_{B'}^{-1} f β_B
	=
	F(G(g)) F(G(f))
	=
	F(G(g) G(f))
\]
and therefore~$G(gf) = G(g) G(f)$.
This shows that~$G$ is indeed a functor.

The family~$β = (β_B)_{B ∈ \Ob(\cat{B})}$ is (by construction) a natural isomorphism from~$FG$ to~$1_{\cat{B}}$.
For every object~$A$ of~$\cat{A}$ we have the morphism
\[
	β_{F(A)}
	\colon
	FGF(A) \to F(A) \,.
\]
It follows that there exists a unique morphism
\[
	α_A
	\colon
	GF(A) \to A
\]
such that~$β_{F(A)} = F(α_A)$ because~$F$ is both full and faithful.
The morphism~$α_A$ is an isomorphism because~$F$ is fully faithful and therefore reflects isomorphisms.
The family~$α = (α_A)_{A ∈ \Ob(\cat{A})}$ is a natural isomorphism from~$GF$ to~$A$:
We need to show that for every morphism~$f \colon A \to A'$ in~$\cat{A}$ the following square diagram commutes:
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}[sep = large]
		GF(A)
		\arrow{r}[above]{GF(f)}
		\arrow{d}[left]{α_A}
		&
		GF(A')
		\arrow{d}[right]{α_{A'}}
		\\
		A
		\arrow{r}[above]{f}
		&
		A'
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
It suffices to show that this diagram commutes after we apply the functor~$F$ to it because~$F$ is faithful.
We hence need to show that the following square diagram commutes:
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}[sep = large]
		FGF(A)
		\arrow{r}[above]{FGF(f)}
		\arrow{d}[left]{β_{F(A)}}
		&
		FGF(A')
		\arrow{d}[right]{β_{F(A')}}
		\\
		F(A)
		\arrow{r}[above]{F(f)}
		&
		F(A')
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
This desired commutativity follows from the naturality of~$β$.
