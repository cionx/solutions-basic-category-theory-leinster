\subsubsection{}

Let~$(P, \leq)$ be an ordered set and let~$\Pcat$ be the corresponding category.
A subcategory~$\Qcat$ of~$\Pcat$ is the same as a subset~$Q$ of~$P$ together with a partial order~$\preceq$ on~$Q$ such that~$x \leq y$ whenever~$x \preceq y$.
In other words, a subcategory~$\Qcat$ of~$\Pcat$ is the same as an ordered set~$Q$ that is subordinate to~$P$.
Such a subcategory is full if and only if~$P$ and~$Q$ are equal as sets.





\subsubsection{}

Let~$G$ be a group and let~$\Gcat$ be the corresponding one-object category.
A subcategory~$\Hcat$ of~$\Gcat$ is the same as a submonoid~$H$ of~$G$ or the the empty set.
The only full subcategories of~$\Gcat$ are~$G$ and the empty set.
