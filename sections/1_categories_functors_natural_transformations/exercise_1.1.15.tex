For any two continuous maps~$f$ and~$g$ from a topological space~$X$ to another topological space~$Y$ we write~$f ≃ g$ to mean that~$f$ and~$g$ are homotopic.

The composition of morphisms in~$\Top$ descends do a composition of morphisms in~$\Toph$ thanks to the following observation:
\begin{quote}
		\itshape
		Let~$X$,~$Y$ and~$Z$ be topological spaces.
		Let
		\[
			f, f' \colon X \to Y \,,
			\quad
			g, g' \colon Y \to Z
		\]
		be continuous maps.
		If both~$f ≃ f'$ and~$g ≃ g'$, then also~$g ∘ f ≃ g' ∘ f'$.
\end{quote}

For any topological space~$X$, the identity morphism of~$X$ in~$\Toph$ is given by the homotopy class of the identity map on~$X$.
It follows that two topological spaces~$X$ and~$Y$ are isomorphic in~$\Toph$ if and only if there exist continuous maps
\[
	f \colon X \to Y \,,
	\quad
	g \colon Y \to X
\]
such that both~$g ∘ f ≃ \id_X$ and~$f ∘ g ≃ \id_Y$.
In other words, two topological spaces become isomorphic in~$\Toph$ if and only if they are homotopy equivalent.
(More explicitly, a continuous map becomes an isomorphism in~$\Toph$ if and only if it is a homotopy equivalence.)
